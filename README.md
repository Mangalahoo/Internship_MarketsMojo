# Internship Project - MarketsMojo

This project was developed during an internship at MarketsMojo. It involves the integration, analysis, and modeling of financial data from multiple countries. The project focuses on identifying key financial ratios that impact benchmark and index prices using advanced feature selection techniques. Please note that the actual dataset used in this project cannot be disclosed due to company confidentiality agreements.

## Introduction
This project, completed as part of an internship with MarketsMojo, demonstrates the process of financial data integration, feature selection, and predictive modeling. The goal was to create a comprehensive dataset from multiple financial markets and identify the most significant financial ratios influencing benchmark and index prices. Advanced data analysis techniques were applied to gain insights into market performance. Due to company policy, the actual dataset used cannot be shared publicly.

## Features
- **Data Integration**: Combined financial data from the US, China, Japan, and India.
- **Feature Selection**: Identified top financial ratios using advanced techniques.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Applied statistical analysis and machine learning to identify key market drivers.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Mangalahoo/Internship_MarketsMojo.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd Internship_MarketsMojo
    ```

3. Install the necessary dependencies using `requirements.txt`:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Open the Jupyter notebook:

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Analysis.ipynb
    ```

## Usage

1. After opening the Jupyter notebook (`Analysis.ipynb`), follow the steps to see how financial data is cleaned, analyzed, and modeled.
2. The notebook demonstrates:
   - Data loading and preprocessing.
   - Feature selection techniques like Correlation Analysis, Lasso Regression, Random Forest, PCA, and more.
   - Visualization of feature importance and predictive model results.
   
   Please note: Dummy data may be used for demonstration purposes in place of the confidential dataset.

## Dataset
The project uses financial data from four countries: the US, China, Japan, and India. The dataset consists of:
- 42 financial ratios.
- Index prices and benchmark prices.

However, the actual dataset used for this project is confidential and not displayed, as sharing it would violate company policy.

## Analysis
The analysis includes:
- **Feature Selection**: Techniques such as Correlation Analysis, Lasso Regression, Random Forest, Mutual Information Regression, RFE, Extra Trees, SelectKBest, and PCA were applied to identify the top 10 financial ratios that impact benchmark and index prices.
- **Feature Validation**: OLS regression was used to validate the statistical significance of the selected features.
- **Visualization**: Feature importance and model results were visualized using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Scikit-learn**: For feature selection, regression models, and machine learning techniques.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For running and demonstrating the project.
